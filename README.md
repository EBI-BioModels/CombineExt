# Extensions for COMBINE projects

This is library is meant to help you working with standards from the [COMBINE community](http://mbine.org). Everyone is invited to use and/or extend it!

The library currently contains two modules:

* [Formatizer](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext/wiki/CombineFormatizer): detect the format of a file
* [Iconizer](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext/wiki/CombineIconizer): retrieve an icon representing a format

Find more information on how to use and extend the library on the [web page of the library](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext/wiki).
